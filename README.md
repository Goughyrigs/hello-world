# hello-world
my first repository
Hi there
3d printing has become a new passion of mine. I decided to buy the original prusa kit and I am close to completing the first of 4 clones. As with most projects I feel I wasn't realistic about how much time and resources it would take to complete. However, being faced with unforseen challenges, and exploring different skills and technologies has been thoroughly enjoyable.
